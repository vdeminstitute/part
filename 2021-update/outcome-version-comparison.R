#' There are substantial differences in the sets of identified negative
#' Regimes of the World (RoW) indicator changes between the v9 and v11 version
#' of the V-Dem data.
#'
#' The v9 and v11 versions of the RoW change data range jointly from 1970 to
#' 2019. The v9 version has 188 negative RoW changes in that period;
#' v11 has 154. Furthermore, the sets of cases identified are quite different:

table(v9 = both$v9pos, v11 = both$v11pos)

#' Only 121 cases are identified in both. The v9 data has 67 changes that are
#' not in v11 and vice versa there are 33 in v11 that are not in v9.
#'
#' That's a challenge for assessing the accuracy of forecasts. In essence, if
#' we develop forecasts using the v9 V-Dem data, and then score it with the
#' v10 or v11 V-Dem data, the ground will have shifted under us. I'm not sure
#' that there is anything to do about this. We had the same problem with the
#' democratic spaces project and discussed this issue in the spring of 2020
#' when we did the v10 update.
#'
#' The underlying problem is that the RoW indicator depends on thresholds in a
#' variety of other indicators, and the values of those other indicators shift
#' slightly when the measurement models are re-run with each data update. Even
#' though such shifts might be miniscule, they can in some cases cross a
#' relevant threshold, thus changing the RoW category.
#'
#' Below is a table of positive cases in either dataset.
