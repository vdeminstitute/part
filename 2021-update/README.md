Notes for the 2021 forecast update
==================================

This folder has notes related to the spring 2021 forecast update. Also see the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for more detailed, technical changes. 

_Forecast check_: Several European countries score relatively high risk for 2021-2022--namely Norway and Denmark, but also others. The [Europe note](europe-note.md) digs into several of those cases, in order to rule out model or data errors as a cause. As both Norway and Denmark are close to the relevant thresholds for the transparent law and access to justice for women indicators that would move them from liberal to electoral democracy, the high forecasts seem to be warranted.

_Shifting ground_: The ground truth of historical, observed adverse regime transitions (ARTs) changes between V-Dem versions. The  [outcome-version-comparison.md](outcome-version-comparison.md) note compares the v9 version of the V-Dem (and PART) data, which the last prior set of forecasts are based on, to the current v11 version. This comparison is based on the overlapping set of years for which both data versions have complete records: 1970 - 2018. Only 64% of ARTs in the v9 data are also in v11; 80% of v11 ARTs are also in v9. This is a problem for making accurate forecasts: the ground truth shifts under us.
